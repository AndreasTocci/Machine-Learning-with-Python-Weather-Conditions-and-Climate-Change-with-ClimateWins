# Machine Learning with Python: Weather Conditions and Climate Change with ClimateWins

## Objective
This project is a continuation of the previous achievement, where you will build on the skills learned by applying them to real-life situations. You will continue working as a data analyst at ClimateWins, a nonprofit organization focused on climate change. The goal is to explore practical applications of machine learning to predict the consequences of climate change in Europe and potentially worldwide. (DISCLAIMER THIS ANALYSIS IS PART OF A BOOTCAMP AND IS AN EXERCISE PROVIDED BY CAREERFOUNDRY)

## Project Background
ClimateWins aims to assess available tools for categorizing and predicting weather patterns in mainland Europe, particularly in light of the increasing frequency of extreme weather events over the past 10 to 20 years. The organization believes that advanced machine learning tools can help predict and plan for these weather extremes using historical data. The project will focus on the following areas:

## Key Questions
Finding new patterns in weather changes over the last 60 years.
Identifying weather patterns that deviate from regional norms in Europe.
Determining whether unusual weather patterns are on the rise.
Generating predictions for future weather conditions over the next 25 to 50 years based on current trends.
Identifying the safest places for people to live in Europe in the coming decades, considering the growing issue of climate refugees.

## Data
Dataset based on weather observations from 18 different weather stations across Europe, covering data from the late 1800s to 2022. The dataset includes daily recordings of various metrics such as temperature, wind speed, snow, and global radiation, collected by the European Climate Assessment & Data Set project.

## Tools Used
Anaconda/Jupyter - For training, optimization and analysis of Machine Learning Models.
